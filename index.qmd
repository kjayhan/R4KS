# Preface {.unnumbered}

Korean Studies is traditionally dominated by scholars of history and literature. Itâ€™s relatively rare to see R, Python, or other computational social science tools being used or taught in this field.

I believe computational social science offers huge opportunities for Korean Studies, not only for quantitative research but also for qualitative studies, including those on history and literature!

In this book, I aim to increase data literacy and convince as many Korean Studies scholars and students as possible about the relative ease of learning R with code samples, and motivational case studies about Korea.

This book is supposed to be a gentle introduction, so I do not go into the details of the R language. You can refer to the links that I provide in this book for more information. Furthermore, I also strongly encourage you to use [`Github's Copilot`](https://github.com/features/copilot) which is free for academic use, [`Chatgpt`](https://chat.openai.com/) which is not necessarily a coding bot, but still helpful especially for simple tasks, [`Stackoverflow`](https://stackoverflow.com/), and [`Google`](https://www.google.com) for help whenever you are stuck or come across an error.

I also encourage you to join our bootcamps for problem solving! You can [sign up for my newsletter to get updates on the workshops](https://mailchi.mp/29054dcc1b0d/dr-ayhan-newsletter).
