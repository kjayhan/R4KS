# Preface {.unnumbered}

Korean Studies is traditionally dominated by scholars of history and literature. Itâ€™s relatively rare to see R, Python, or other computational social science tools being used or taught in this field.

I believe computational social science offers huge opportunities for Korean Studies, not only for quantitative research but also for qualitative studies, including those on history and literature!

In this book, I aim to increase data literacy and convince as many Korean Studies scholars and students as possible about the relative ease of learning R with code samples, and motivational case studies about Korea.

I also encourage you to join our bootcamps for problem solving! You can [sign up for my newsletter to get updates on the bootcamps](https://mailchi.mp/2a64f70942f3/r4ks).
