    "text": "Preface\nKorean Studies is traditionally dominated by scholars of history and literature. It’s relatively rare to see R, Python, or other computational social science tools being used or taught in this field.\nI believe computational social science offers huge opportunities for Korean Studies, not only for quantitative research but also for qualitative studies, including those on history and literature!\nIn this book, I aim to increase data literacy and convince as many Korean Studies scholars and students as possible about the relative ease of learning R with code samples, and motivational case studies about Korea.\nI also encourage you to join our bootcamps for problem solving!

    "text": "1.1 “Why Do I Need Computational Tools in Korean Studies?”\nSimply put, there is so much more data out there that is useful for Korean Studies research, and we have faster computers, and handy tools to analyze such data.\nKorean Studies curricula across the world are quite rich and interdisciplinary. Those courses often equip students with the history, culture, literature, and language of Korea to understand the country better. Yet, Korean Studies scholars and students are not exposed to computational methods/ tools that can handle big or complex data as much.\nIf you are already here, it probably means that you appreciate the increasing importance of the computational tools in your research. This book, and bootcamps based on this book, will teach you the basics of R, and give you sample codes based on Korean Studies-related examples.\nIn the age that we live in, I strongly believe that these computational methods/ tools will empower you in your research as well as in the job market given wide range of prospective jobs Korean Studies graduates seek and find (corporations, international organizations, think tanks, NGOs, media, academia etc.).",

Many more are being built as you read this book! You can do from simple math to data pre-processing, from data visualization to regressions, from building your CV to building your website, from analyzing tweets to machine learning.\nPython is probably getting more popular in the industry jobs in recent years. Yet, I think, for the time being, R is better suited for social science research. At least there are more books, tutorials, examples that you can learn from in terms of social sciences.\nOnce exposed to R, you may also consider learning Python as well if it seems more attractive for you.",

I don’t expect the readers, and bootcamp participants, to have any prior knowledge of R, coding, or other statistical software.\nThis book is supposed to be a gentle introduction, so I do not go into the details of the R language. You can refer to the links that I provide in this book for more information. Furthermore, I also strongly encourage you to use Github's Copilot which is free for academic use, ChatGPT which is not necessarily a coding bot, but still helpful especially for simple tasks, Stackoverflow, and Google for help whenever you are stuck or come across an error.\nLearning curve is steep in the beginning. So you may need a trigger to begin and NOT GIVE UP. This book plays this trigger role. So, there is no need to be intimidated by R, or your lack of background with coding. I got you covered!",

You will be asked to choose a directory for your project. Choose a directory where you want to store your project files. You can also create a new directory for your project. After you have chosen a directory, click on “Create Project”. You will see a new RStudio window with your project. You can now start working on your project.\nFor now, this is all you need to know about creating a project. We learn more about projects that are connected with Github in the Productivity Tools chapter.\nWhen you work within a project, managing the files for your project becomes easier. When you work within the project, you don’t need to worry about getting and setting your working directory. To give you an idea, this is how you can find the working directory for your project:\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/pd/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/R/projects/R4KS\"\nYou can also set the working directory to some other path using the setwd() function. But you don’t need to do this when you work within a project. On another note, when you are writing code script in an R script file or within a code chunk, you can add non-code comments like this by adding a # sign at the beginning of the line.\n# You can uncomment a comment line and make it a code line by removing the '#' sign at the beginning of the line.\n\n# Replace \"path/to/your/directory\" with the actual path to your directory (folder) that you want to work in.\n\n# Try removing the '#' sign at the beginning of the line and running the code.\n\n# setwd(\"path/to/your/directory\")\nWhen you work within a project, you don’t need to worry about the working directory. You can store all the files for your project in the project directory. You can also save your R scripts in the project directory. This way, you can easily find the files for your project.",

    "text": "4.2 Scripting in R\nYou can simply type your R code in the console and press Enter to run the code. But this is not a good practice. You should write your code in a script file and then run the script file. This way, you can save your code and run it again whenever you want. You can also share your code with others.\nOne of the most important advantages of R, for example over Excel, is that you can reproduce your results. That’s why you should write your code in a script file. Every time you exit R, you should save your R script(s) and then rely on them next time you work on the same project.\n\n4.2.1 Creating a New R Script\nThe most basic way to create a new R script is to click on the “File” menu, then “New File”, and then “R Script”. You will see a new R script file in the RStudio editor. You can now write your R code in this file.\n\n\n4.2.2 Creating a Quarto File\nYou can also create a new Quarto file by clicking on the “File” menu, then “New File”, and then “Quarto File”. You will see a new Quarto file in the RStudio editor. You can now write your R code in this file.\nQuarto allows you to write your code in chunks. In between chunks, you can have other text, images, and other content. You can also run the code in each chunk and see the output in the document. This is a great way to write reports, papers, and books.\nPersonally I prefer to write my code in Quarto files. When you click to create a new Quarto file, it will ask you to add a title and author, and select a format for your Quarto file. I explain Quarto further in the Storytelling with Quarto chapter. For now, click “Create Empty Document” on the left bottom. Click File &gt; Save and save you Quarto document in your project directory.\nOn the top right of the RStudio editor, you can see a green C button with a + sign. That button allows you to insert a code chunk in your document. See Figure 4.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Quarto: Inserting a New Code Chunk\n\n\n\nThen after you write your code and when you want to run the code in a chunk, you can click on the green Run button on the right side of the chunk. See Figure 4.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Quarto: Running a Code Chunk\n\n\n\nWhen you are working in a simple R script, you don’t need to worry about chunks. You can simply write your code in the script file and select the lines of code you want to run and click on the Run button.",

For example, you can assign the value 14 to a variable x using the following command:\n\nx &lt;- 14\n\nAfter assigning 14 to x, you can use x in your code. For example, you can print the value of x using the following command:\n\nprint(x)\n\n[1] 14\n\n\nSee, x is now 14. You can also see the value of x by typing x in the console and pressing Enter. Try it.\n\nx\n\n[1] 14\n\n\nYou can also make additional data manipulations using x and assign it to another variable y using the following command:\n\ny &lt;- x + 3\n\nLet’s see the value of y:\n\ny\n\n[1] 17\n\n\nR is an advanced calculator. You can do all kinds of calculations using R. For example, check out the following calculations:\n\n# Square root of 16\nsqrt(16)\n\n[1] 4\n\n# 2 to the power of 8\n2^8\n\n[1] 256\n\n# Logarithm of 100\nlog(100)\n\n[1] 4.60517\n\n# Exponential of previously assigned value y, i.e. 17, times x, i.e. 14.\nexp(y) * x\n\n[1] 338169339\n\n\nYou can also assign a character string to a variable. For example, you can assign the string “한국학 학자들 및 학생들도 R 좀 배웠으면 좋겠다.” to a variable z using the following command:\n\nz &lt;- \"한국학 학자 및 학생들도 R 좀 배웠으면 좋겠다.\"\n\nYou can print the value of z using the following command:\n\nz\n\n[1] \"한국학 학자 및 학생들도 R 좀 배웠으면 좋겠다.\"",

Make sure to get the spelling right.\nIf you want to use more than two words for a variable name, you can use an underscore _ (my_variable) or a dot . (my.variable) to separate the words; or you can write the words together with each new word beginning with a capital letter (myVariable). You better be consistent with your naming convention, although technically you can name your variables however you want.

For example, you can see the last few rows of the dataframe df using the following command:\n\ntail(df)\n\n  city_name_en city_name_kr population\n1        Busan         부산        3.3\n2        Daegu         대구        2.4\n3      Incheon         인천        3.0\n4        Seoul         서울        9.4\n5      Daejeon         대전        1.4\n\n\nIn this example, both the head() and tail() functions show the entire dataframe because the dataframe df has only 5 rows. But, in longer dataframes, you can see the first or last few rows using these functions.\nIn a similar vein, glimpse() function from the dplyr package is a function to see the structure of a dataframe. For example, you can see the structure of the dataframe df using the following command:\n\nglimpse(df)\n\nRows: 5\nColumns: 3\n$ city_name_en &lt;chr&gt; \"Busan\", \"Daegu\", \"Incheon\", \"Seoul\", \"Daejeon\"\n$ city_name_kr &lt;chr&gt; \"부산\", \"대구\", \"인천\", \"서울\", \"대전\"\n$ population   &lt;dbl&gt; 3.3, 2.4, 3.0, 9.4, 1.4\n\n\nThe nrow() function gives the number of rows in a dataframe. For example, you can see the number of rows in the dataframe df using the following command:\n\nnrow(df)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nLikewise, the ncol() function gives the number of columns in a dataframe. For example, you can see the number of columns in the dataframe df using the following command:\n\nncol(df)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nThe dim() function gives the dimensions of a dataframe. For example, you can see the dimensions of the dataframe df using the following command:\n\ndim(df)\n\n[1] 5 3\n\n\nThe summary() function gives a summary of a dataframe. For example, you can see the summary of the dataframe df using the following command:\n\nsummary(df)\n\n city_name_en       city_name_kr         population \n Length:5           Length:5           Min.   :1.4  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:2.4  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :3.0  \n                                       Mean   :3.9  \n                                       3rd Qu.:3.3  \n                                       Max.   :9.4",

    "text": "4.11 Rows and Columns\nYou can select rows and columns of a dataframe using the [] operator. The first argument of the [] operator is the row index, and the second argument is the column index. df[row, column] selects the row with the index row and the column with the index column.\nFor example, you can select the first row and the second column of the dataframe df using the following command:\n\ndf[1, 2]\n\n[1] \"부산\"\n\n\nYou can select the first row of the dataframe df using the following command:\n\ndf[1, ]\n\n  city_name_en city_name_kr population\n1        Busan         부산        3.3\n\n\nYou can select the second column of the dataframe df using the following command:\n\ndf[, 2]\n\n[1] \"부산\" \"대구\" \"인천\" \"서울\" \"대전\"",

    "section": "4.12 Piping",
    "text": "4.12 Piping\nThe pipe operators |&gt; and %&gt;% are powerful tools in R.1 The pipe allows you to write code in a more readable way. You can use the pipe operator to pass the output of one function to the input of another function. For example, you can use the pipe operator to pass the dataframe df to the head() function. You can see the first few rows of the dataframe df using the following command:\n\ndf |&gt; head()\n\n  city_name_en city_name_kr population\n1        Busan         부산        3.3\n2        Daegu         대구        2.4\n3      Incheon         인천        3.0\n4        Seoul         서울        9.4\n5      Daejeon         대전        1.4\n\n\nWe can arrange the dataframe df using the arrange() function from the dplyr package. For example, you can arrange the dataframe df by the population column using the following command with a pipe:\n\ndf |&gt; arrange(population)\n\n  city_name_en city_name_kr population\n1      Daejeon         대전        1.4\n2        Daegu         대구        2.4\n3      Incheon         인천        3.0\n4        Busan         부산        3.3\n5        Seoul         서울        9.4\n\n\narrange() function arranges the dataframe by the selected numeric column in ascending order by default. If it is a character column, it arranges the dataframe in alphabetical order. You can arrange the dataframe in descending order by using the desc() function. For example, you can arrange the dataframe df by the population column in descending order using the following command:\n\ndf |&gt; arrange(desc(population))\n\n  city_name_en city_name_kr population\n1        Seoul         서울        9.4\n2        Busan         부산        3.3\n3      Incheon         인천        3.0\n4        Daegu         대구        2.4\n5      Daejeon         대전        1.4\n\n\nWe can also assign df to the rearranged dataframe. For example, you can assign the arranged dataframe to df using the following command:\n\ndf &lt;- df |&gt; arrange(desc(population))\n\nNow, df is arranged by the population column in descending order. Let’s check out:\n\ndf\n\n  city_name_en city_name_kr population\n1        Seoul         서울        9.4\n2        Busan         부산        3.3\n3      Incheon         인천        3.0\n4        Daegu         대구        2.4\n5      Daejeon         대전        1.4\n\n\nGood.

For now, I will use the local pdf file since the MOFA might change the url for the pdf later. That is why I commented the download code. You can comment the earlier code for the local pdf file and uncomment the following code for the online pdf file.\n\n# Download PDF\n#file &lt;- tempfile()\n\n# This url works for now.

We will unlist each line as we did earlier so that we can see the table in a more readable way.\n\n# Look at the first 10 lines of the 4th page\nlines_pdf_4 &lt;- pdf_text_all[4] |&gt; \n  # Split by newline character.\n  str_split(\"\\n\") |&gt; \n  # Unlist\n  unlist()\n\nFirst, let’s look at the 29th and 30th lines for the column names in the pdf file.\n\nlines_pdf_4[29:30]\n\n[1] \"                  ‘24년     ‘23년      ‘24년 예산         ‘23년 예산\"\n[2] \"       기관명\"                                                       \n\n\nThe column names are the line number, province or city’s name, project numbers for 2024 and 2023 respectively, and the budget for 2024 and 2023 in million Korean Won respectively. Let’s use the following English column names that correspond to the Korean column names in the pdf file.\n\n# Column names\ncol_names &lt;- c(\"no\", \"province_city\", \"project_no_2024\", \"project_no_2023\", \"budget_2024\", \"budget_2023\")\n\nBy observing the lines_pdf_4 object using view(lines_pdf_4), we can see that the second table starts from the 32nd line and ends on the 48th. We will extract only those lines. We will use str_trim “removes whitespace from start and end of string”. We will also use str_replace_all to remove commas from each line to convert entries into numbers. We will then split each line based on two or more consecutive spaces (our string is “\\s{2,}”) using str_split and simplify the result into a matrix. We will convert this matrix into a data frame with non-factor columns using data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE). We will set the column names of the data frame using the col_names vector that we created above. These explanations are also available in each step in the following code chunk.\n\n# Select lines 32 to 48 from the lines_pdf_4 data frame\nprovince_city_pd &lt;- lines_pdf_4[32:48] |&gt;\n  # Trim whitespace from both ends of each element in the selected rows\n  str_trim() |&gt;\n  # Replace all commas with an empty string in each element\n  str_replace_all(\",\", \"\") |&gt;\n  # Split each element based on 2 or more consecutive spaces and simplify into a matrix\n  str_split(\"\\\\s{2,}\", simplify = TRUE) |&gt;\n  # Convert the matrix into a data frame with non-factor columns\n  data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) |&gt;\n  # Set column names for the data frame using the provided 'col_names' vector\n  setNames(col_names)\n\nLet’s rearrange the table (which is originally in alphabetical order) by descending order based on public diplomacy budgets in 2024.\n\nprovince_city_pd |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(budget_2024))\n\n   no  province_city project_no_2024 project_no_2023 budget_2024 budget_2023\n1   8       경상남도               8              10        미정        1408\n2  17 세종특별자치시               8               9          96         373\n3   3       충청북도               7               8         789         736\n4   2 강원특별자치도              10              11       78593       11024\n5  13     인천광역시              26              25        5516        5008\n6   9 제주특별자치도              23              24        4433        7343\n7  15     대전광역시              38              44        3685        3848\n8  14     광주광역시              22              26        3487        6459\n9  12     대구광역시              11              11         316         321\n10 11     부산광역시              36              35        3017        2355\n11  6       전라남도              13              13        2962        6917\n12  7       경상북도              18              18        2709        3314\n13  5       전라북도              19              19        2626       10703\n14  4       충청남도              10              10        2508        1731\n15  1         경기도              25              14       21558        3899\n16 16     울산광역시              17              14        1302         660\n17 10     서울특별시              31              31       10005        9628\n\n\nBut these province_city names are in Korean since the document was in Korean. Let’s practice extracting a table from internet then to find English names for these Korean provinces or cities. As of May 6, 2024, Wikipedia’s list of South Korea’s administrative divisions seems to be correct. Let’s extract the table there.",

    "text": "9.5 Text Analysis\n\n9.5.1 Word Frequency\nThis time let’s look at all of the text in the 2024 Public Diplomacy Comprehensive Implementation Plan. We will combine all the text into a single character vector.\n\n# Combine text\npdf_text &lt;- str_c(pdf_text_all, collapse = \" \")\n\nWe will now split the text into words using the str_split function from the stringr package. We will then convert the result into a data frame with non-factor columns using the data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) function. We will set the column name of the data frame as word.\n\n# Split the text into words\nwords &lt;- pdf_text |&gt;\n  # Split the text into words\n  str_split(\"\\\\s+\") |&gt;\n  # Convert the result into a data frame with non-factor columns\n  data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) |&gt;\n  # Set the column name of the data frame as \"word\"\n  setNames(\"word\")\n\nLet’s look at the first 10 rows of the data frame.\n\nhead(words, 10)\n\n           word\n1              \n2        2024년\n3      공공외교\n4  종합시행계획\n5          개요\n6             \n7          수립\n8          근거\n9             ❑\n10   공공외교법\n\n\nNow, let’s count the frequency of each word in the text using the count function from the dplyr package package. We will then arrange the result in descending order based on the frequency of the words.\n\n# Count the frequency of each word\nword_freq &lt;- words |&gt;\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\nLet’s look at the first 10 rows of the data frame\n\nhead(word_freq, 10)\n\n       word  n\n1        및 72\n2         - 55\n3  공공외교 40\n4        등 33\n5        ㅇ 28\n6     개최, 22\n7      통한 22\n8      사업 18\n9      제고 18\n10     강화 17\n\n\nThis is not very useful. There are two main issues with Korean text. First, Korean text does not have consistent spacing between words. Second, Korean text has particles and other morphemes that are not words. We will address these issues now.\n\n\n9.5.2 Spacing in Korean Text\nLet’s get the spacing right in Korean text using the bitNLP package’s get_spacing function, which will add spaces between words in the Korean text. So, for example “한국공공외교” will become “한국 공공 외교”.\n\n# Get the spacing right in Korean text\npdf_text_ko &lt;- get_spacing(pdf_text)\n\nNow, let’s split the text into words again using the str_split function from the stringr package.\n\n# Split the text into words\nwords_ko &lt;- pdf_text_ko |&gt;\n  # Split the text into words\n  str_split(\"\\\\s+\") |&gt;\n  # Convert the result into a data frame with non-factor columns\n  data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) |&gt;\n  # Set the column name of the data frame as \"word\"\n  setNames(\"word\")\n\nLet’s analyze the word frequency in the text again.\n\n# Count the frequency of each word\nword_freq_ko &lt;- words_ko |&gt;\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\nhead(word_freq_ko, 10)\n\n   word   n\n1     ▴ 175\n2     (  97\n3     -  80\n4    및  73\n5  외교  67\n6  공공  62\n7  국제  36\n8  사업  35\n9    등  33\n10 해외  30\n\n\nWe have many special characters in the text. Let’s remove all characters except for Korean characters, spaces, English letters, and numbers using the str_replace_all function from the stringr package.\n\n# Remove all characters except for Korean characters, spaces, English letters, and numbers\nword_freq_ko &lt;- pdf_text_ko |&gt;\n  # Remove all characters except Korean characters, English letters, numbers, and spaces\n  str_replace_all(\"[^가-힣a-zA-Z0-9\\\\s]\", \"\") |&gt;\n  # Split the cleaned text into words based on one or more spaces\n  str_split(\"\\\\s+\") |&gt;\n  # Convert the list result into a data frame with non-factor columns\n  data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) |&gt;\n  # Set the column name of the data frame as \"word\"\n  setNames(\"word\")\n\nLet’s analyze the word frequency in the text again.\n\n# Count the frequency of each word\nword_freq_ko &lt;- word_freq_ko |&gt;\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\nhead(word_freq_ko, 10)\n\n   word  n\n1    및 73\n2  외교 67\n3  공공 62\n4  개최 44\n5  사업 37\n6  국제 36\n7    등 35\n8  해외 30\n9  문화 29\n10 추진 28\n\n\nThis is much better! We have removed the special characters and have more meaningful words in the text.\nWe can also remove some common stopwords in Korean using the stopwords function in stopwords package along with the stopwords-iso library that has Korean stopwords.\n\nstopwords &lt;- stopwords(\"ko\", source = \"stopwords-iso\") |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  setNames(\"word\")\n\n# Remove stopwords\n\nword_freq_ko &lt;- word_freq_ko |&gt;\n  # anti_join (remove) stopwords\n  anti_join(stopwords, by = \"word\")\n\nLet’s count the frequency of each word in the text again.\n\nhead(word_freq_ko, 10)\n\n   word  n\n1  외교 67\n2  공공 62\n3  개최 44\n4  사업 37\n5  국제 36\n6  해외 30\n7  문화 29\n8  추진 28\n9  운영 25\n10 강화 24\n\n\nThis way, we removed words such as 및 (and) and 등 (etc.) from the text.\nLet’s move on to morpheme analysis which makes more sense in Korean text analysis context.\n\n\n9.5.3 Morpheme Analysis in Korean Text\nLet’s analyze the morphemes in the Korean text using the morpho_mecab function from the bitNLP package, which will extract morphemes from the Korean text.\n\n# Analyze the morphemes in the Korean text\nmorphemes &lt;- morpho_mecab(pdf_text_ko)\n\nThis creates a list of character vectors, where each element corresponds to a morpheme in the text. We can also combine all of the morphemes and tokenize them into a single character vector.\n\n# Combine all the morphemes into a single character vector\n\nmorphemes_single &lt;- morpho_mecab(pdf_text_ko, indiv = FALSE)\n\nNow, let’s split the text into words again this time by converting morphemes_single into a data frame using the as.data.frame function. We will set the column name of the data frame as “word”.\n\n# Split the text into words\nwords_morphemes &lt;- morphemes_single |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  # Set the column name of the data frame as \"word\"\n  setNames(\"word\")\n\nWe will now count the frequency of each morpheme in the text using the count function from the dplyr package package. We will then arrange the result in descending order based on the frequency of the morphemes.\n\n# Count the frequency of each morpheme\n\nmorpheme_freq &lt;- words_morphemes |&gt;\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\nhead(morpheme_freq, 10)\n\n   word  n\n1  외교 68\n2  공공 62\n3  개최 46\n4  국제 39\n5  사업 37\n6  해외 30\n7  문화 29\n8  추진 28\n9  운영 26\n10 계획 25\n\n\nNow, this is more like it!\nLet’s visualize the frequency of the morphemes in the text using a bar plot. Before that let’s address the font issue with Korean text in the plot.\nKorean text sometimes is not visible in the graph due to the font issue. This was the case in my Macbook. Let’s set the font to one that supports Korean characters. We will use the extrafont package to set the font to one that supports Korean characters. We will use the font_import function to import the fonts from the system. This may take some time. You only need to do it once. That’s why I commented it. You can uncomment it in first usage.\n\n# Load extrafont and register fonts\n\n#font_import()  # This might take a while if it's the first time you're running it\n\nWe will then use the loadfonts function to load the fonts. We will use the fonts function to display the available fonts and find one that supports Korean characters. We will set the font to one that supports Korean characters. For now, I have chosen “Arial Unicode MS” as the Korean font. You can replace it with a font from your system that supports Korean characters if necessary.\n\n#loadfonts(device = \"all\")\n\n# Display available fonts, find one that supports Korean\n#fonts()\n\n# Set the font to one that supports Korean characters\nkorean_font &lt;- \"Arial Unicode MS\"  # Replace with a font from your system that supports Korean if necessary\n\nWe will use the ggplot function from the ggplot2 package to create the plot. We will use the geom_col function to add the bars to the plot. We will use the theme_minimal function to set the theme of the plot to minimal. We will use the theme function to adjust the font size in the plot. We will set the font size to 10. We will use the labs function to add the title and labels to the plot. We will visualize only the most frequent 20 morphemes in the text.\n\n# Visualize the frequency of the morphemes in the text\n\nmorpheme_freq |&gt; \n  top_n(20) |&gt; \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) |&gt; ggplot(aes(word, n)) + \n  geom_col(fill = \"#2196f3\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  # use Korean font\n  theme(text = element_text(family = korean_font, size = 10)) +\n  labs(title = \"Frequency of Morphemes in Korean Text\", x = \"Morpheme\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.5.4 Word Network in Korean Text\nLet’s analyze the word network in the Korean text using the tokenize_noun_ngrams function from the bitNLP package which builds on tidytext package. We will use the tokenize_noun_grams function to extract the noun word network from the Korean text.\n\n# We can use a user-defined dictionary to improve the accuracy of the tokenization. We will rely on the one provided by the `bitNLP` package.\n\ndic_path &lt;- system.file(\"dic\", package = \"bitNLP\")\ndic_file &lt;- glue::glue(\"{dic_path}/buzz_dic.dic\")\n\nword_network &lt;- tokenize_noun_ngrams(pdf_text_ko, simplify = TRUE, user_dic = dic_file, n = 2) |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  setNames(\"paired_words\")\n\nNow, let’s separate the paired words into two columns using the separate function from the tidyr package which is loaded as part of the tidyverse package. This will allow us to create bigrams from the paired words.\n\nword_network_separated &lt;- word_network |&gt;\n  separate(paired_words, c(\"word1\", \"word2\"), sep = \" \")\n\nWe will now count the frequency of each bigram in the text using the count function from the dplyr package package, which is also party of the tidyverse. We will then arrange the result in descending order based on the frequency of the bigrams.\n\n# new bigram counts:\nword_network_counts &lt;- word_network_separated |&gt;\n  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)\n\nWe will now create a graph from the bigram counts using the graph_from_data_frame function from the igraph package. We will use the ggraph function from the ggraph package to create the graph. We will use the geom_edge_link function to add the edges to the graph. We will use the geom_node_point function to add the nodes to the graph. We will use the geom_node_text function to add the labels to the nodes in the graph. We will set the font to the Korean font that we set earlier. We will then adjust the font in the graph. Here, n &gt;= 6 is used to filter out bigrams that appear less than 6 times. You can adjust this number as needed. You can check out ggraph layout options here.\n\nword_network_select &lt;- word_network_counts |&gt;\n  filter(n &gt;= 6) |&gt;\n  graph_from_data_frame() |&gt;\n  ggraph(layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(color = \"#2196f3\", size = 4) +\n  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), family = korean_font, vjust = 2, size = 4) +  # Set family to Korean font\n  theme_void()\n\n\nword_network_select\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.5.5 Sentiment Analysis\n\n\n9.5.6 Topic Modeling",

    "text": "14.1 #kdiplo #kdiploviz\nI love Korea, and I love data.\nCombining my enthusiasm for Korean Studies and data, I am initiating an exciting project to make engaging and valuable Korean datasets publicly accessible… in an enjoyable manner!\nI invite you to explore and interact with the data I will be sharing. Let’s craft stories together using these datasets and connect through the hashtags #kdiplo, #kdiploviz, #kdata, and #kdataviz.\nRecently, I have created several novel datasets on Korean diplomacy for my research1, mainly focusing on high-level diplomatic visits (both outgoing and incoming), their formats (bilateral, multilateral, informal), nature (such as state visits), purposes (economic, security, etc.), timelines, and the conveners in multilateral contexts among others.\nI will make these datasets available via a new R package, #kdiplo. Although this is a work in progress, the first version is already shaping up.\nThe current development version features a pivotal function (along with an accompanying dataset) designed to assist researchers in merging various Korean datasets by country names. Due to inconsistent naming conventions across Korean government datasets (for instance, Thailand might appear as 태국 [Taeguk] or 타이 [Tai]), the kdiplo::iso3c function creates iso3c country codes for Korean country names, simplifying the joining process (similar to countrycode::countrycode).\nNext on the agenda is adding comprehensive Korean trade data spanning from 1948 to 2023, inclusive of multiple sources and estimations/ imputations for missing data.\nMore datasets are on the way, and I am open to data requests.\nStay tuned (follow hashtags #kdiplo, #kdiploviz #kdata, and #kdataviz) for more updates on (https://github.com/kjayhan/kdiplo) - a one-stop public repository for data insights on Korean diplomacy and foreign policy!\nFor now check this website out, which I will soon update as well.",

    "text": "14.2 #kdata #kdataviz\nWhile my main interests in Korean Studies lie in foreign policy and (public) diplomacy, I am also interested in everything related to Korea, from business to education to culture.\nIndeed, I was trained as an economist, with a double major in international trade, wrote my master’s thesis on Korean popular culture (from an international relations angle), and have published at least 8 peer-reviewed articles on international student mobility programs (from a public diplomacy angle).\nSo… in addition to the #kdiplo package, I am happy to announce that, I am also building another package, #kdata, dedicated to datasets on Korean business, culture, and education. Although this is a work-in-progress, I have already uploaded multiple datasets to the #kdiplo repository. I will upload documentation and vignettes for these datasets soon.\nTo kick things off with the vibrant Spring season in Korea, I present our first challenge: the Korean Festivals dataset! 🌸🎎🎇\nExplore and interact with the data available at #kdiplo kdiplo::korean_festivals_data.\nCheck out my blog post where I’ve used this dataset.\nI encourage you to dive into this dataset and share your insights. Remember to use hashtags #kdiplo, #kdiploviz #kdata, and #kdataviz in your posts across various social media platforms!",
