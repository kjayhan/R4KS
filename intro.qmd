# Introduction

Main purpose: triggering interest in R in Korean Studies community.

Korean Studies heavily remain historical studies, and literature. Recently more interest in pop culture.

Qualitative-heavy.

Fear of coding.

Show that it is easy with examples, code samples, and motivational case studies.

Let's start with the basics. There are very good books, tutorials. Here, I will give the very basics and some sources you can refer to for more information. There is always Google and chatbots (including Copilot) that you can get help from whenever you are stuck or come across an error. You can also join our workshops for problem solving!
